Unfortunately, the treasure is a trap prepared by a crafty pirate to punish rivals.

Brief but heavy rainstorms are unnaturally frequent, passing overhead at least twice a day but never lasting more than an hour at a time. While traveling through the miniature jungle composing the majority of the island, conventional methods of tracking or finding direction are impossible, with the plant life and terrain manipulating themselves to create entirely new layouts many times throughout the day. All but the most potent of pathfinding or similar spells fail to take effect within the boundaries of the greenery, and any attempts at teleportation or planar travel are instantly shut down upon casting. It is only during the rainstorms that the trickery of the jungle is suppressed, allowing both conventional and magical means of entering and exiting the vegetation.

Both islands have rocky soil, bluffs, and are covered in pine.

The wind seems to warm for the climate and it feels extremely humid. Mist starts to spread, a mist with the stench of rotten eggs. The island seems to consist of one big mountain, surrounded by a beach. On its shores you see dead fish, birds and monsters everywhere, mostly small ones. As time passes and the tide comes in, the sand is covered by water and you see water flow through cracks into the mountain. Some time after the tide is at the highest point, a deep grumbling sound can be heard and felt. A huge cloud of water breaks free from the mountain. A wall of steam threatens every living thing to be cooked alive.", "An island that\u2019s just below sea level, inhabited by fish-like dwarves.", "Undecayed island \u2013 an island made up entirely of flotsam and waste of previous civilizations caught in a current\u2019s eddy.

In the center though, there is a well that seems to go down forever, and radiates warmth. Turns out it\u2019s a portal to a hellish plane.", "This island is completely surrounded by a tall stone wall, with no door. Within, there is a city with a population that doesn\u2019t know about the world out there. They might be fascinated or terrified by the party, but they will certainly refuse to believe in the existence of the outside world. They will attribute the adventurers\u2019 origin to some unique deity.", "An island filled with dead, dry trees. The soil is covered by a thin layer of ash. Magic users can detect a strong source of dark magic underground. If the party decides to dig down, they will find an old, rotting wizard den, with some valuable loot, but that might give them a disease or insanity if they stay there for more than a couple minutes.", "A transparent bubble surrounds this island, that seems to have an isolated atmosphere. Inside, there is tropical vegatation, and a large wooden building. If the party decides to get in, they will meet a friendly elven couple. They claim to have built this house hundreds of years ago, with the help of a mage.", "This mountainous island is extremely large, and is filled with massive trees.

No, wait, I mean a dessert island. The island is made of sweets, cakes, and other things that\u2019ll rot your teeth out. Even the flora and fauna are edible and full of sugar.

Untold riches line the halls, but nobody\u2019s ever returned to cash in on their fortune.", "A seemingly normal island that a lot of people have visited and have been to.

Volcanic glass covers the floor, resembling grass. Who knows what resides here?", "A tiny piece of dirt in the middle of the ocean. Maybe two people can stand on it if you try.", "A perfectly ordinary island, with a beach, and a forest further inland. At least it would be ordinary were it not floating 100 feet above sea level, kept aloft by unknown magic.", "A small rocky island with a huge gilded lighthouse dominating its highest point. The cliff faces have been carved into neat terraced gardens, and a cove contains a small but nice harbor that appears to be well equipped for repairing ships- all in all a nice place to restock, resupply, and perhaps do some trading. Ships that approach, however, will discover that the murky waters around this island hide a veritable minefield of shallow reefs, rocks, and shipwrecks, all of which are nearly impossible to spot and avoid. Fortunately, the island\u2019s inhabitants are a friendly tribe of kobolds who will happily make skilled repairs to the party\u2019s likely sinking ship for a rather large fee. The local inn offers a small discount to those staying during ship repairs- bringing down the rates to a mere \u2018extremely high\u2019. These kobolds are excellent craftsmen, so there are a wide variety of (somewhat expensive) goods available at the trading post. Lastly, the kobolds also charge a fee to show the party the safe way back out to sea when the party goes to leave, which may vary depending on the party\u2019s behavior. Should the party complain, the kobolds point out the giant lighthouse they built to warn people. (Brilliant scam or reason to facepalm, it\u2019s up to you.)", "A medium sized island that is perfect for a settlement, there\u2019s houses and a small town but it is completely abandoned.

No evidence of inhabitance but the trees that were located here are now charred and reduced in some places to charcoal.", "An island naturally split into two separate islands, a bridge connects them and each side is home to a village that is convinced they are better than the other.

The island is restocked by those who visit and the few people that live here are eager for new people to talk to.", "A tiny rocky island with a large tower, the top is illuminated by a very powerful Light spell.

He will paint portraits of all who visit him but will destroy them hours later as they did not meet his standards and do not show his inspiration for art.", "A large island that changes location frequently, it is actually a huge dragon turtle that people have settled on. They feed it and maintain it, watching its health and ensuring it is happy, and the dragon turtle returns the favor by keeping them safe and allowing them to live on its back.

Optional: the goddess is only satisfied with an offering of deep meaning to the party, they must care more for their lives than an object or suffer her wrath.", "A group of small, black, rocky islands.

Small caves dot the surface of the spire, with sea birds making the alcoves their home.", "An ugly hunk of rock, 2 miles long, covered in strange plants and fungi. The surface of the island is always oily to the touch, and sea creatures tend to get sick if they dwell near the island.", "A small glacier no more than 500ft. wide that has frozen a derelict ship inside it. The ship is over a century old.", "A small rocky island. On the South side, a dock pokes tentatively out of the mouth of a cave at sea level. A long staircase winds up inside the rock from the cave to a temple on the top of the island, long abandoned. The Western side houses a small beach, then a sheer cliff overlooked by the temple gardens, now overgrown. The rest of the island is barren rock, rising upwards from the sea.", "Geyser Rock: This is a stone shape barely visible below the water and close enough to the surface to walk on. Unperceptive sailors may find themselves beached on its underwater shores. The waters surrounding the stony expanse are warmer and more sulfuric than normal due to regular geysers spouting from the underwater stone floor.", "Moss mats: What appears to be a very grassy and very flat island from afar reveals itself to be a free-floating mat of ocean vegitation. It\u2019s home to a complex ecosystem of seaweed, moss, bugs, amphibeous fish, and tentacle horrors, as well as several key alchemy ingredients normally only found on the ocean floor. It\u2019s too loose to stand on near the edge, but further in it\u2019s like standing on a water bed, making it difficult terrain. Don\u2019t jump around too much because creatures CAN fall through.", "Booty Island: This is just a very large and very thickly forested boot-shaped island. From the outside, it appears to greatly change in elevation. In reality, this is simply the trees growing taller and taller the further inland they are. From the beach, the forest looks rather impenetrable, but it quickly clears up as long spaces vetween larger and larger trees appear. This island is primarily home to three types of creatures: four armed simians about the size of a human that live in the trees and subsist on large beetles, omnivorous boars the size of cars which eat large mushrooms and run down any living thing they see and gore them with their large tusks, and amphibious deer-like fish which move in herds and flee the ocean or the island depending on where they are threatened. There are other animals such as colorful birds and cat-like predators as well. The party may find a destroyed village between the enormous trees.", "Mysterious cube: This island only reveals itself when people are within 1 mile of it, at which point it suddenly appears. Its a perfect cube 100Ã—100Ã—100 feet and sits just above the water line. Made of slightly rusted iron in tetris shapes, its only feature is in the exact center. A square pillar of iron 1Ã—1 foot and 40 feet tall, at the top is a gem that glows bright red. If taken or damaged, the island\u2019s cloaking disappears and the gem loses its power. The lines between the tetris shapes then begin to glow redly.", "Oasis: This is a near-perfect circle of sand. The sandy shore making up the circle is ten feet wide, and 20 banana and coconut trees are equally spaced around it. In the middle of the circle is a dark-blue pond that is terribly deep despite the surrounding sediment. The pond is fresh water, even if it\u2019s in the ocean. (Their could be a water purification gem in the pond if they can swim deep enough.)", "An island 100 ft x 100 ft made of salt. In a caldera with 15 ft high cliffs surrounding it, lies some sort of wonderland of salt in crystaline form. Crystals wary from grains to 3 ft in diameter. This must have been a place where a falling star had thrashed into the earth, boiling away all the water leaving behind the salt. While covered with seawater in heavy storms, the sun always dries the crater back up, forming beautiful crystals. (meteorite ore can be found if searched for) This island ( 20 square miles and oval shaped) has coral reef beaches of white sand as well as three mountains, overgrown by lush dense jungle. It is always humid and each day around 4 in the afternoon, heavens gates open to unleash a downpour of torrential rain, featuring drops as big as a thumb. Plants are beautiful but carnivorous, only birds reside on this island, even those ar not save from the springing vines in the high trees. When searching the island, remnants of an old culture can be found, the mountains are man made(aztec style) and feature a dark dungeon (in the biggest pyramid) with a lich lord controlling the skeletons of the inhabitants). The story can be decyphered on stone walls inside the pyramid. War between two tribes forces the losing tribe create magical trap plants and retreating into the jungle, so the other faction cant find enough food and gets eaten, gruesome sacrificial necromancy is then used against the losing faction until the whole civilisation collapsed some hundred years ago.", "An island shrouded heavily in mist appears once a year not too far off the coast of the mainland. Few have made the attempt to make it to the island, and far fewer have made it back.

The island is gone by the time the sun comes up over the horizon.", "A large island that has a lake in the center that takes up most of the space on the island.

This must have been a vacation spot decades or even centuries ago. Now the lasting beautiful architecture is the only sign that it was ever inhabited.", "Not so much an island as a wandering clump of Sargasso that circles around the doldrums. Juvenile fish of all sorts shelter here. Lost floating goods can also be found tangled in the weeds. A peaceful leafy sea dragon lairs in the depths of the clump. It gets bored with its treasure collection easily so its hobby is bartering with ships stuck in the doldrums. It offers trades for something else equal in value.", "A plain sandbar that appears for only a few months at a time before moving or sinking. A fortune in rare spotted shells desired by many wash up in pristine condition after storms.", "A small, flat island with a single structure surrounded by trees, an almost-ruined stone tower.
