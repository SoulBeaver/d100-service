The party did not notice the mountain until it was directly upon them.", "The village that you come to has just had adventurers a lot like your party come through, and have prepared an appropriate welcome.

Problem is the area is pretty flat and you don\u2019t understand how the rocks got here.", "A group of animals have been killed and aligned in a strange formation with weird symbols drawn in blood. Party could find out this was used for a ritual of sorts.", "You turn a corner and the road ahead is blocked by a pool of lava. Upon inspection, there is no heat. Futher inspection will reveal it is a illusion spell. Perhaps a silly prank by a wizard. You can walk through the lava.", "As you make your way along the road, you come across a rotting dead animal carcass. The smell is horrid, but it is nothing out of the ordinary. As you continue, a few more animal carcasses are strewn across the road. More and more bodies begin to appear along the road the further you go. You eventually come face to face with a 20ft wall stacked full of bodies ranging from livestock, predatory animals, and even people.

Although the water is 3 feet deep, the current is so swift that it will without fail sweep away anyone trying to ford it. Individuals swept away face the risks of bludgeoning, impalement on debris, and drowning. By stepping in it at the shallower edge, it is obvious to even survival novices that it will be extremely dangerous to cross, especially towards the middle.

Then the illusion breaks \u2013 this Mirage Arcane made this deep cave look like a clear plains with a nice lovely stone path identical to the one you\u2019ve been following. You are half a mile into this cave, and the fey who have lured you here do NOT want you to leave without doing something for them first.", "Modrons: Along the path you find a group of modrons (2 monodrones and a duodrone). These modrons were not given the return order during the last modron march (due to complications from becoming attacked) and are still trying to collect data.

They continue to do this until they either lose sight of the party or are destroyed.", "A fire can be seen just under a mile away in an obviously cultivated field, the wind now blows billows of smoke over the road the party is crossing.

You\u2019ll either need to make constitution saving throws or find new food.", "A massive and extremely powerful dragon ambushes you somewhere along your journey through a massively dense and vast forest.

Players bust be careful with their footing as well as not grouping up to close together.", "You find two exact similar dwarfs fighting each other with crossbows and taking cover.
